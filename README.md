# ponies
A GUI wrapper around cabal. Currently pre-Alpha.

# goals
The goal of this project is to provide an intuitive GUI interface around the cabal system with the aim of, one, impressing newbies with the quality of Haskell tooling (even speciously), and two, making it easy to work with the Haskell build system.

# status
This is currently stalled awaiting work by the author on building a bidirectional parser of .cabal files, as well as building up the application side to support editing and writing of cabal files.

The project is relatively rushed, and will need rewrite refactors, especially on the application side.
